rcs-fast-import unpacks a git fast-import stream into an RCS file tree

I wrote this as a prod at more recent and putatively more advanced
version-control systems that don't have .fi importers yet.  If crufty
old RCS can import these streams, why can't yours?

The metadata in modern DVCSes can't really be stuffed back into RCS,
but this tool makes a valiant effort and may occasionally be useful
for extracting the revision histories of individual files from a
project history.

It keeps the revision structure, comments, authorship dates, and tag names.
It loses tag dates and comments and authorship information; commits are
recorded as though they were from the user invoking it.  However, all
import-stream metadata is preserved in RFC-822-style headers in commits.
